# Identify Customer Segments

## Introduction
Within this project, we engaged with authentic data generously supplied by Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution. 
The dataset revolves around a German company specializing in mail-order sales. 
The primary objective is to discern characteristics within the population that exhibit a higher likelihood of becoming customers in a targeted mailout campaign. 
Employing unsupervised machine learning techniques, we organize the overall population into clusters and subsequently investigate which clusters constitute the primary user base for the company.
